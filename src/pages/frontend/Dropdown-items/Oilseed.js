        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p className="text-indent">Oil Seed Crops are primarily grown for the oil contained in the seeds and widely used in cooking across Pakistan. The oil content percentage in oil seed crops varies from 20 % to 60 % depending upon the size and variety. Many oilseed crops are grown in Pakistan predominantly as a source of vegetable oil. The commonly grown varieties are Rapeseedmustard, groundnut and sesame, which are grown in the country for a long period. Sunflower, soybean and safflower have been introduced recently in the country. There are also some oilseed crops, which are mainly used for industrial purposes, such as linseed and castor. Presently, local production of oilseeds meets only about 32% percent of the total country's requirements for edible oil.</p>
        <h3>Benefits of Oil Seed Crops</h3>
        <p >There are many benefits and advantages of growing oil seed crops such as: </p>
        <h5>Grown in any Farm System:</h5>
        <p className="text-indent">Almost all the varieties of oil seed crops can be grown in any farming system. These crops are mostly weather resistant and can be grown in all sorts of weather conditions and have the following advantages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>These crops are easy to grow and do not require any till farm practice.</li>
              <li>Oil seed crops can be easily grown in mulch till as well as no till farms.</li>
              <li>No specific mechanization is required and can be easily grown through conventional farming methods.</li>
            </ul><br /><br />
        <h5>Rotational Crops:</h5>
        <p className="text-indent">Out of all the varieties of oil seed crops, some of them are summer varieties and others are winter varieties. So they can be used as a form of rotational crops between the conventional crops grown in summer and winter season which leads to soil fertility and enhances the nutrient composition of soil for other crops to be grown.</p>
        <h5>Support for Pest Management:</h5>
        <p className="text-indent">Oil seed crops are ideal for pest hit land as when grown, they change the chemical pesticide formulation to assist in weed and disease control. All the varieties of oil seed crop helps in reducing the grassy weed hence providing optimum produce. These crops are also resistant to insects. </p>
        <h5>Addition to Soil Health and Quality:</h5>
        <p className="text-indent"> As these crops also serve the purpose of rotational crops, their farming helps in making the soil fertile thus increasing the soil sustainability. Oil seed crops are tap root crops so they break the tillage pans by utilizing the different moisture profiles. These crops also help in reducing the soil erosion and help in keeping it firm thus increasing the chances for soil microbial activity which is  required for the optimum crop growth and production.</p>
