      <p className="text-indent">Black-eyed peas are a type of legume. They are actually a bean, not a pea. They are related to cowpeas, or goat peas. Historically, they originate in West Africa, but they grow in warm regions around the globe. <br /> Black-eyed peas get their name from their appearance. They are cream in color with a little black speck that resembles an eye in the center, outlining where they were once attached to pods. As with other types of beans, people can purchase them canned or dried.</p>

        <h3>Side effects</h3>
      <p className="text-indent">One of the downsides of eating beans regularly is that it can cause a build-up of intestinal gas. If people experience this, there are a few things they can do. First, it is best to introduce high-fiber foods gradually into the diet, particularly if a person is not used to eating them. Another tactic is to soak the dried beans before cooking them, as this makes them easier to digest. <br /><br /> People can try taking digestive enzymes before or during meals that contain a lot of fiber. There are also many over-the-counter remedies for bloating, indigestion, and gas. Consult a doctor before taking any new supplements, such as digestive enzymes, as they may not be suitable for everyone.</p>
