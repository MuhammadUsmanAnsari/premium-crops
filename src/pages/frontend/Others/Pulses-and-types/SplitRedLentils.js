          <p className="text-indent">Split Red Lentils are popularly known as ' masoor dhuli dal ' in India and are very commonly used in Indian cuisine. This is a variant of the masoor dal where the dal is removed of its black skin, revealing a red or orange body and is split into two halves resulting in flat shaped lentils. These lentils belong to a bushy plant of the legume family, which bears pods which contain these lentils. Split Red Lentils cook very quickly and easily and turn creamy and golden coloured on cooking. Since they are soft they require no soaking prior to cooking. They are mild flavoured, hence are tempered with oil and different spices. These lentils are valued for their protein content and are considered the third richest plant food in protein.</p>
          <h3>Health benefits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Split red lentils are abundant in antioxidants which prevent and reduce cell and tissue damage that leads to ageing rapidly.</li>
              <li>These are a rich source of fiber which in turn is good for your digestion because fibre pushes the waste materials out of the gut easily. This is beneficial for the stomach as it requires lesser amounts of stomach acid and bile for digestion which helps prevent problems such as digestive inflammation, stomach ulcers, and colon cancer.</li>
              <li>These are rich in vitamins A, C, E, copper, and zinc, which are important nutrients that protect and strengthen vision.</li>
              <li>They contain iron which helps in the development of red blood cells in the body and thus prevents anaemia.</li>
              <li>It also has immune boosting properties due to the presence of zinc in it.</li>
