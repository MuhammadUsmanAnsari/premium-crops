            <p className="text-indent">Adzuki beans also provide good amounts of antioxidants, which are beneficial plant compounds that can protect your body against aging and diseases (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source). Studies show that adzuki beans may contain up to 29 different types of antioxidants, making them one of the most antioxidant-rich foods available . However, like all beans, adzuki beans also harbor antinutrients, which reduce your bodyâ€™s ability to absorb minerals from the beans. Soaking, sprouting and fermenting the beans prior to eating them are three good ways to reduce antinutrient levels and make the beans easier to digest</p>
