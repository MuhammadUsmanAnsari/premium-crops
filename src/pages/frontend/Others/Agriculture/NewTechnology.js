                                innovation in agriculture equipment to help protect bees and maximize their pollination
                                capabilities.BVT uses commercially reared bees to deliver targeted crop controls through
                                pollination, replacing chemical pesticides with an environmentally safe crop protection
                                system.</p>
                            <p className="text-indent">The system doesn't require spraying water or the use of tractors.
                                Instead, the scientifically designed bumblebee hive allows bees to pick up a trace
                                amount of pest control powders on their legs to spread as they travel within the field.
                                This innovation in agriculture technology supports improved sustainable farming, crop

                                blueberries, sunflowers, apples, and tomatoes, and it also works for farms of all sizes.

                                tonnes. However, farmers don't have to face this limitation when using indoor vertical

                                closed and controlled environment. The technology uses growing shelves mounted

                                <li><strong>Aeroponics</strong> suspends the roots of the crops in the air, with

                                usage, which conserves energy, and reduced labor costs due to the use of robots for

                                field. In the past, farmers relied on traditional scarecrows to ward off hungry
                                invaders. But today, farm owners and managers are turning to high-tech devices with
                                motion sensors to keep birds from pillaging crops.</p>
                                <p className="text-indent">After discovering that birds are sensitive to the color green, a
                                    researcher from the University of Rhode Island helped design a laser scarecrow, which
                                    projects green laser light. The light isn't visible by humans in sunlight, but it can
                                    shoot 600 feet across a field to startle birds before destroying crops.</p>
                                    <p className="text-indent">Early tests with laser scarecrows found that the devices can minimize
                                        crop damages by reducing the bird population around farmlands by up to 70% to 90%.</p>
